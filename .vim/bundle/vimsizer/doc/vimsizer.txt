INTRODUCTION                                                        *vimsizer*

Vimsizer is a simple plugin that was inspired by the Firesizer extension for
Firefox. This plugin gives you the ability to define a re-usable set of window
dimensions. There are two default sizes that are defined with the
|vs_window_sizes| variable: >

    let vs_window_sizes = {"normal": "150 40", "bigger": "210 50"}

You can define your own set of sizes. Example: >

    let vs_window_sizes = {"miniscule": "25 10", "magiscule": "200 60"}

Once the window sizes have been defined then you can use the
|VSSelectWindowSize| command to switch. Example: >

    :VSSelectWindowSize bigger
    :VSSelectWindowSize normal

You can also quickly switch to any specific size you like with the
|VSWindowSize| command. Example: >

    :VSWindowSize 100 20

You can use the |autogroup| command to set the window size on startup.
Example: >

    au VimEnter * exe 'VSSelectWindowSize normal'

This would set the window size to `normal` upon entering vim for the first
time.

You could also |map| a shortcut key to a window size. Example:

    map <leader>1 :VSSelectWindowSize normal<CR>
    map <leader>2 :VSSelectWindowSize bigger<CR>

VIMSIZER SETTINGS                                           *VimsizerSettings*

vs_window_sizes                                              *vs_window_sizes*

    This is a dictionary of size name to window dimension settings. You can
    set this to the list of pre-defined sizes that you want. Example >

        let vs_window_sizes = {"size1": "100 20", "size2": "80 40"}
< 
    The size name can be anything you like. The dimensions are defined by
    separating the |columns| and |lines| by a space, "columns lines"

VIMSIZER COMMANDS                                           *VimsizerCommands*

Vimsizer creates a few new commands for you to use. They are described here.

:VSSelectWindowSize [size_name]                           *VSSelectWindowSize*

    Select a pre-defined size from the list of |vs_window_sizes|. Hitting tab
    will cycle through all the sizes defined.

:VSWindowSize [columns] [lines]                                 *VSWindowSize*

    Quickly change the window size to the given |columns| and |lines|

:VSShowWindowSizes                                         *VSShowWindowSizes*

    Show a detailed listing of all the |vs_window_sizes| available.
